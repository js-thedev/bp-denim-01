          <h2>Washing Your Denim</h2>
          <p>
            General rule of thumb is to wash after every 10 wears unless it
            smells or has a severe stain.<br />
            <br />
            The washing process described here focuses on minimizing impacts on
            the denim and the clothes you wash with your denim.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Button Up</h3>
          <p>
            Keep the buttons in place, prevent snagging and damage other
            clothes.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Turn Inside Out</h3>
          <p>Minimize contact, prevent unintended fades on denim</p>
          <h3>3. Wash With Similar Colors</h3>
          <p>Prevent indigo transfer to other clothes.</p>
          <h3>4. No Overloading</h3>
          <p>
            Overloading the washing machine while washing your denim could leave
            vertically folded trace on denim.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Mild Detergent, No Softners</h3>
          <p>Softners shortens the lifespan of the fabric.</p>
          <h3>6. Cold Water</h3>
          <p>Hot water will expedite the color loss.</p>

          <h2>Drying Your Denim</h2>
          <p>
            Always line dry in shade to dry your denim. Using artificial heat to
            dry the moisture out of any piece of clothing will shorten the
            lifespan of the fabric. Unless it is absolutely necessary (i.e. you
            are at hotel and you need to checkout the next day), avoid using
            dryer and let the water dry out by itself.
          </p>

          <h2>Storing Your Denim</h2>
          <p>
            You would always want to avoid direct sunlight when storing your
            denim. Sun is strong enough to bleach the color away from your
            clothes.<br />
            <br />
            Right after washing and drying, you can put your denim in your
            closet. When you're storing your denim in between your wears, put it
            on a hanger and leave some room around it. This way, natural
            ventilation will buy you some time before your denim starts to
            smell.

          <h2>Intentions Behind This Denim</h2>
          <p>
            There are more sophisticated ways to treat denim more
            professionally, but this guide was written to provide a minimal
            guidance on treating denim.<br />
            <br />
            At the end of the day, it is just a piece of clothing. Every piece
            of clothing from Banana Pose is created with a hope that it will
            serve as a tool that will keep you comfortable, both physically and
            mentally, while you work on yourself to conquer your world. As such,
            treating your denim should not be something stressful and the
            process should be kept at its minimal.<br />
            <br />
            There is nothing to be stressed about even if your denim get unusual
            stains or wears. It will just be a reflection of your journey with
            your denim, and your denim becomes a personal diary that only you
            can read what happened.<br />
            <br />
            Wishing you an enjoyable journey with your denim.
