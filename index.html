        <p>
          There are more sophisticated ways to treat denim more professionally,
          but this guide was written to provide a minimal guidance on treating
          denim.<br />
          <br />
          At the end of the day, it is just a piece of clothing. Every piece of
          clothing from Banana Pose is created with a hope that it will serve as
          a tool that will keep you comfortable, both physically and mentally,
          while you work on yourself to conquer your world. As such, treating
          your denim should not be something stressful and the process should be
          kept at its minimal.<br />
          <br />
          There is nothing to be stressed about even if your denim get unusual
          stains or wears. It will just be a reflection of your journey with
          your denim, and your denim becomes a personal diary that only you can
          read what happened.<br />
